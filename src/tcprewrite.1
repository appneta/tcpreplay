.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tcprewrite is a tool to rewrite packets stored in @file{pcap(3)} file format,
such as crated by tools such as @file{tcpdump(1)} and @file{ethereal(1)}.
Once a pcap file has had it's packets rewritten, they can be replayed back
out on the network using @file{tcpreplay(1)}.
tcprewrite currently supports reading the following DLT types:
@item
@var{DLT_C_HDLC} aka Cisco HDLC
@item
@var{DLT_EN10MB} aka Ethernet
@item
@var{DLT_LINUX_SLL} aka Linux Cooked Socket
@item
@var{DLT_RAW} aka RAW IP
@item
@var{DLT_NULL} aka BSD Loopback
@item
@var{DLT_LOOP} aka OpenBSD Loopback
@item
@var{DLT_IEEE802_11} aka 802.11a/b/g
@item
@var{DLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO} aka 802.11a/b/g with Radiotap headers
@item
@var{DLT_JUNIPER_ETHER} aka Juniper Encapsulated Ethernet
@item
@var{DLT_PPP_SERIAL} aka PPP over serial with HDLC encapsulation
Please see the --dlt option for supported DLT types for writing.
The packet editing features of tcprewrite which distinguish between "client"
and "server" traffic requires a tcpprep(1) cache file.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS ""
.TP
.BR \-r " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-portmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite TCP/UDP ports.
This option may appear up to -1 times.
.sp
Specify a list of comma delimited port mappingings consisting of
colon delimited port number pairs.  Each colon delimited port pair
consists of the port to match followed by the port number to rewrite.
Examples:
.nf
    \--portmap=80:8000 \--portmap=8080:80    # 80->8000 and 8080->80
    \--portmap=8000,8080,88888:80           # 3 different ports become 80
    \--portmap=8000-8999:80                 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80
.fi
.TP
.BR \-s " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-seed "=" \fInumber\fP
Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
Causes the source and destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo 
randomized but still maintain client/server relationships.
Since the randomization is deterministic based on the seed, 
you can reuse the same seed value to recreate the traffic.
.TP
.BR \-N " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-pnat "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 2 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
srcipmap.
.sp
Takes a comma delimited series of colon delimited CIDR
netblock pairs.  Each netblock pair is evaluated in order against
the IP addresses.  If the IP address in the packet matches the
first netblock, it is rewriten using the second netblock as a
mask against the high order bits.
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=[2001:db8::/32]:[dead::/16],[2001:db8::/32]:[::ffff:0:0/96]
.fi
.TP
.BR \-S " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-srcipmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite source IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pnat.
.sp
Works just like the \--pnat option, but only affects the source IP
addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.BR \-D " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-dstipmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite destination IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pnat.
.sp
Works just like the \--pnat option, but only affects the destination IP
addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.BR \-e " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-endpoints "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite IP addresses to be between two endpoints.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
cachefile.
.sp
Takes a pair of colon delimited IPv4/v6 addresses which will be used to rewrite
all traffic to appear to be between the two IP addresses.
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--endpoints=172.16.0.1:172.16.0.2
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--endpoints=[2001:db8::dead:beef]:[::ffff:0:0:ac:f:0:2]
.fi
.TP
.BR \-b ", " -\-skipbroadcast
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 addresses.
.sp
By default \--seed, \--pnat and \--endpoints will rewrite 
broadcast and multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses.	Setting this flag
will keep broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses from being rewritten.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " -\-fixcsum
Force recalculation of IPv4/TCP/UDP header checksums.
.sp
Causes each IPv4/v6 packet to have their checksums recalcualted and
fixed.  Automatically enabled for packets modified with \fB--seed\fP, 
\fB--pnat\fP, \fB--endpoints\fP or \fB--fixlen\fP.
.TP
.BR \-m " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-mtu "=" \fInumber\fP

This option may appear up to 1 times.

The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  1 through MAXPACKET
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Override the default 1500 byte MTU size for determining the maximum padding length 
(--fixlen=pad) or when truncating (--mtu-trunc).
.TP
.BR \-\-mtu\-trunc
Truncate packets larger then specified MTU.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Similar to \--fixlen, this option will truncate data in packets from Layer 3 and above to be 
no larger then the MTU.
.TP
.BR \-E ", " -\-efcs
Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.
.sp
Note, this option is pretty dangerous!  We do not actually check to see if a FCS
actually exists in the frame, we just blindly delete the last 4 bytes.  Hence,
you should only use this if you know know that your OS provides the FCS when 
reading raw packets.
.TP
.BR \-\-ttl "=\fIstring\fP"
Modify the IPv4/v6 TTL/Hop Limit.
.sp
Allows you to modify the TTL/Hop Limit of all the IPv4/v6 packets.  Specify a number to hard-code
the value or +/-value to increase or decrease by the value provided (limited to 1-255).

    \--ttl=10
    \--ttl=+7
    \--ttl=-64
.fi
.TP
.BR \-\-tos "=\fInumber\fP"
Set the IPv4 TOS/DiffServ/ECN byte.

This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 1048575
.fi
.in -4
.sp

packets.
.TP
.BR \-F " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-fixlen "=" \fIstring\fP
Pad or truncate packet data to match header length.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Packets may be truncated during capture if the snaplen is smaller then the
packet.  This option allows you to modify the packet to pad the packet back
out to the size stored in the IPv4/v6 header or rewrite the IP header total length
to reflect the stored packet length.
.sp 1
\fBpad\fP
Truncated packets will be padded out so that the packet length matches the 
IPv4 total length
.sp 1
\fBtrunc\fP
Truncated packets will have their IPv4 total length field rewritten to match
the actual packet length
.sp 1
\fBdel\fP
Delete the packet
.TP
.BR \-\-skipl2broadcast
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast Layer 2 addresses.
.sp
By default, editing Layer 2 addresses will rewrite 
broadcast and multicast MAC addresses.	Setting this flag
will keep broadcast/multicast MAC addresses from being rewritten.
.TP
.BR \-\-dlt "=\fIstring\fP"
Override output DLT encapsulation.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp

When enabling verbose mode (\fB-v\fP) you may also specify one or
more additional arguments to pass to \fBtcpdump\fP to modify

.sp
In some cases, packets can not be decoded or the requested editing
is not possible.  Normally these packets are written to the output
file unedited so that tcpprep cache files can still be used, but if

In that case, the file "\fI.tcprewriterc\fP"
is searched for within that directory.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
