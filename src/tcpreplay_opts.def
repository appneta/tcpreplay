explain = <<- EOExplain
tcpreplay is a tool for replaying network traffic from files saved with
tcpdump or other tools which write pcap(3) files.
EOExplain;

detail = <<- EODetail
The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend  all  packets  from  the
input file(s) at the speed at which they were recorded, or a specified 
data rate, up to as fast as the hardware is capable.

Optionally, the traffic can be split between two interfaces, written to
files, filtered and edited in various ways, providing the means to test
firewalls, NIDS and other network devices.

For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at:
http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac/wiki/manual

man-doc = <<- EOMan
.SH "SIGNALS"
tcpreplay understands the following signals:
@enumerate
@item @var{SIGUSR1}
Suspend tcpreplay
@item @var{SIGCONT}
Restart tcpreplay
@end enumerate

.SH "SEE ALSO"
tcpreplay-edit(1), tcpdump(1), tcpprep(1), tcprewrite(1), libnet(3)

.SH "BUGS"
tcpreplay can only send packets as fast as your computer's interface,
processor, disk and system bus will allow.

Packet timing at high speeds is a black art and very OS/CPU dependent.  

Replaying captured traffic may simulate odd or broken conditions on your
network and cause all sorts of problems.

In most cases, you can not replay traffic back to/at a server.

Some operating systems by default do not allow for forging source MAC
addresses.  Please consult your operating system's documentation and the
tcpreplay FAQ if you experience this issue.

stored in the pcap file which is usually the correct thing to do.  However,
occasionally, tools will store more bytes then told to.  By specifying this

packets based on the original packet length.  Bad things may happen if
you specify this option.
